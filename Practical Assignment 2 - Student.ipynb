The data has been standardized, de-trended, and anonymized. You are provided with thousands of observations and nearly 800 features. Each observation (instance) is independent from the previous. \n","\n","For each observation, it was recorded whether a default was triggered (i.e. whether an individual could not pay back the loan). In case of a default, the loss for the bank was measured. This quantity lies between 0 and 100. If the loan did not default, the loss for the bank was 0. You are asked to predict whether a loan will default or not for each individual in the test set.\n","\n","Missing feature values have been kept as is, so that the competing teams can really use the maximum data available, implementing a strategy to fill the gaps if desired. Consider all variables continuous, even though some variables may be categorical (e.g. f776 and f777).\n","\n","The goal of the machine learning algorithm will be to predict whether a loan will default, given a set of features. For privacy reasons the feature names are not provided.\n","\n","**Important Note**: This second assignment is not as instructive as the first assignment. The first assignment guided you step-by-step through all the preprocessing, training-validation-testing setup, etc. This assignment does not do so, but it leaves it up to you to decide how to use the data and design your experiments."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"cdc9100b2eb32f795318f88531439408","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-3a36fe2e430fa9ab","locked":true,"schema_version":1,"solution":false},"pycharm":{"is_executing":false},"id":"k63PQb_KJF0L"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv('loan_default_10K.csv', sep=\",\", header=0, dtype=np.float64)\n","\n","# Drop the observations that contain missing values\n","dfn = df.dropna(0, how='any')\n","\n","# Consider only a handful of features to start with; you can extend to the full set later on.\n","X = dfn.loc[:,'f400':'f500'].values\n","\n","# Generate the labels; if 'loss' is zero the this indicates the negative class, class 0, i.e. no default;\n","# if 'loss' is possitive this indicates the positive class, class 1, i.e. there is a loan default;\n","y = [ bool(y) for y in dfn.loc[:,'loss'].values ]\n","\n","# Split the data into train, validation, and test.\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, \n","                                                    y, \n","                                                    test_size=0.20)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"ff730342a91fefa515c3117b502aa292","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-735be096b0f642ef","locked":true,"schema_version":1,"solution":false},"id":"0LKlXxS3JF0L"},"source":["### Part 2: Evaluation measures (2pts)\n","In what follows you should implement a number of evaluation measures.
